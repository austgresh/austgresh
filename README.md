- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @austgresh
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new tech and how to make things do things  
- I am new to programming/coding tech but interested in learning
- I work at a university and have assumed responsibilities to bring more tech into the classrooms
- While I can set up a complex system to do all the functions I want, I have to make it as user friendly as possible and fairly fool proof for other faculty and students to walk up and use
- Iâ€™m currently learning about Bitfocus Companion and raspberry Pi.  I want to set up a Companion Pi with a Stream Deck on the front of an AV rack that a user can walk in and press a button to turn on the projector (Panasonic and/or Epson).
- Then I want them to be able to press another button to turn on certain programs on the computer that they will have logged into and ultimatly press an "off" button that will log the computer out and turn off the projector.
- Currently this is done partially with a crestron element but that is expensive and not exactly what I want without spending even more for other crestron programming/equipment.
